# Gusset Plate Design and Visualization General Notes

## Attributes
- Grid Intersection
- Level
- Quadrant + Brace Angle (8 possible)
- Forces (global) - horizontal and vertical (Axial at an angle)

## Failure States/Checks
- Axial force +/-
- Moment
- In Plane Shear
- OOP Shear
- Whitmore section
- Stress Interaction (Von Mises?)
- Shear and Moment DCR
- Web local yielding - J10.2
- Web local crippling - J10.3
- Column interface stresses

## Geometric/Material Limits
- plate thicknesses
- 3 inch offset thing? how is this codified

## Visualization Notes
- include visualization of geometry parameters for design
- 3D potential visualization
- quadrants based on XY plane 
- cross section of beam/column/brace drawn in x,y (initially)
- gusset drawn in x, y (initially) - DONE
- transformation to get beam/column/brace to correct orientation/rotation
    - vector normal to plane
    - web orientation
    - need transformation matrix from one frame to another frame
    - apply transformation matrix to each point
    - orient points method? transformations
    - geometry -> xforms -> transformation -> from_frame_to_frame

### Design Guide Notes
- KISS Method - all vertical force goes to column/gusset interface, all horizontal force goes to beam/gusset interface - not the most economical
- Parallel Force Method - 
- Uniform Force Method

### Geometric Constraints - Gusset Plates
- 3 inch offset for edge of gusset from column - DONE
- 3 inch offset for edge of gusset from beam - DONE
- 2 inch offset from column to brace connection - DONE
- 6 inch offset from beam to brace connection - DONE
- 3 inch offset either side of brace (shoulder) - DONE

### Geometric Constraints - Forces
- 3 Force Polygons
- alpha and beta are unknowns
- beam control point is fixed (x, y)
- H is known and line of action for H is known
- P is known and line of action for P is known
- V is known and line of action for V is known

### Hierarchy for Geometry

- Gusset Node - must have a beam, a column and a brace
    - List of Beams
        - beam
            - start pt/end pt
            - cross section
            - frame
            - properties
    - Column
        - start pt/end pt
        - cross section
        - frame (local to global)
        - properties    
    - List of Braces
        - brace
            - start pt/end pt
            - cross section
            - frame
            - properties
            - gusset
                - can get gusset local quadrant from brace start/end pt
    - to mesh
        - call individual component to mesh

brace - from angle + from
